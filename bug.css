The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors and inheritance:

```css
.parent {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.child {
  font-size: 18px !important;
}

.parent .child {
  font-size: 14px;
}
```

The expected behavior might be that the `.parent .child` selector overrides the others due to its higher specificity.  However, the `!important` flag on `.child`'s font size declaration will override even the more specific selector.
