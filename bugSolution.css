The solution involves removing the `!important` flag and relying on the natural specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
.parent {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.child {
  font-size: 18px;
}

.parent .child {
  font-size: 14px;
}
```

This revised code ensures that the most specific selector (`.parent .child`) takes precedence, leading to a more predictable and maintainable stylesheet.  Using `!important` should be a last resort due to its potential for creating hard-to-debug conflicts and overriding styles in unexpected ways.
